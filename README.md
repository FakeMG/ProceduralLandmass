## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains a Unity project focused on procedural world generation for a Minecraft-like game. The project utilizes the Perlin Worm algorithm for cave generation and the Perlin Noise algorithm for landscape generation. Players are able to break and place blocks within the generated world.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity version 2020.3.32f1 (recommended).

## Features
- Procedural landscape generation using Perlin Noise algorithm
- Cave generation using Perlin Worm algorithm
- Interactive gameplay allowing players to break and place blocks

## Acknowledgments
The Perlin Noise algorithm for landscape generation was adapted from [SebLague](https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Landmass-Generation).
